# Role-Playing-Game-Character-Manager

I associate with a number of language educators that use Role Playing Games (RPG) to interest and challenge their students to expressing themselves in the studied language.  Having a large number of students and RPG sessions makes it difficult for the Dungeon Master (DM) also known as the instructor.  They require the following to help manage student played character data, Non-Player Characters  (NPC) data, and allow notes for events. 
Requirements: 
- A way to add, remove, and update a players information.  
- Players will have abilities that will be added and existing improve over time. 
- Abilities will change depending upon their target. 
- The information should be available via a webpage.  
- Web Page users must login (id/password/account type)
- Session history should be visible for all users, but can only be edited by participants of that session.
