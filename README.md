# Role-Playing-Game-Character-Manager

I associate with a number of language teachers that use Role Playing Games (RPGs) to engage their students and challenge them to express themselves in the studied language. Having a large number of students and sessions makes it difficult for the teachers in their role as Game Master (GM). They require the following to help manage student Player Character (PC) data, Non-Player Character (NPC) data, and allow notes for events. 

Requirements:

•	A way to add, remove, and update a character’s information.

•	Players will have abilities that will be added, and existing ones will improve over time.

•	Abilities will change depending upon their target.

•	The information should be available via a webpage.

•	Web page users must login (id/password/account type)

•	Session history should be visible for all users, but can only be edited by participants of that session.
